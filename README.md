# Meteorite-Fell-and-Found-Visualisation-Project-in-Powerbi
1. Introduction
This project analyses global meteorite landings using an open dataset provided by NASA, originally compiled by The Meteoritical Society. The dataset contains records of 34,513 meteorites, including details such as year, location, mass, meteorite classification, and whether the meteorite was fell (observed falling) or found later. The aim of this project is to explore spatial distribution, mass characteristics, classification patterns, and long-term trends using interactive Power BI visualisations.
2. Data Preparation
The raw dataset was cleaned and transformed before visualisation. Missing or invalid values were handled, mass values were converted into kilograms and tonnes for better interpretation, and date fields were standardised. New calculated measures such as total mass, fell percentage, earliest and latest year, and counts by classification were created to support meaningful analysis. The final data model enabled efficient filtering by year, meteorite type, mass, and fall status.
3. Visual Analysis and Key Insights
Global Distribution:
Map visuals show that meteorite discoveries are concentrated in North America, Europe, and parts of Africa and Australia. These patterns reflect both natural distribution and higher discovery and reporting activity in certain regions.
Fell vs Found:
Only 2.86% of meteorites were recorded as fell, while over 97% were found. This highlights how rare direct meteorite observations are compared to later discoveries.
Mass Characteristics:
The total recorded meteorite mass exceeds 596 tonnes. A small number of very large meteorites contribute disproportionately to total mass.
Heaviest Meteorites:
The bar chart of the top 10 heaviest meteorites shows Hoba, Cape York, and Campo del Cielo as the most massive, each weighing tens of tonnes.
Meteorite Classifications:
Treemap and bar charts show that iron meteorites dominate total mass, while L6, H5, and H6 are the most common by count. This demonstrates a clear difference between frequency and mass contribution.
Trends Over Time:
Time-series analysis indicates a sharp increase in recorded meteorites during the 20th century, largely due to improved scientific reporting and exploration rather than increased meteorite activity.
4. Conclusion
This Power BI project demonstrates how interactive dashboards can be used to analyse large scientific datasets effectively. The findings reveal strong geographical, temporal, and compositional patterns in meteorite landings. Overall, the analysis highlights the dominance of iron meteorites by mass, the rarity of observed falls, and the impact of human activity on discovery trends.
